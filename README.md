## Why Use Happy Hour? :bulb:

Happy Hour is a great for both bar-goers and businesses. If you sign up as a business, you can post your bar and its specials for all to see, and as a user you can explore what bars have the best specials for each day of the week, as well as the opening hours. 

You'll never feel as though you're missing out on key nights out, and you'll save some $$$ too!
